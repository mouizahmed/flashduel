# Flashcard Study System – Vision Statement

The Flashcard Study Tool System called “Flash Study” will be used to allow users to efficiently study and memorize information through the use of highly customizable and accessible digital flashcards with the ability to track progress, custom-tailored weekly study plan, keep up with test dates and evaluate learning through quizzes and gamification for competition with other students while earning rewards as they study. The main goal of this system is to provide an effective, convenient, collaborative and extremely engaging for all types of learners and an accessible way for users to learn and retain information easily.

The system will feature added customization options that include handwriting recognition for written answers and questions, text, images, text-to-speech to allow audio-based learning and adjustable font sizes to help users with disabilities study without any usability issues along with advanced visualization tools for complex subjects (i.e. charts or graphs) to cater to all learning styles that a user may have. The system will be integrated with other productivity tools such as Google Drive, Evernote, and Notion in order to import and export flashcards for a more centralized storage location for ease of access.

Furthermore, the system will also feature a personalized study planner that uses an adaptive learning algorithm (spaced repetition) that adjusts flashcard frequency and difficulty based on user preferences and performance such as time spent studying, correct answer rate, completion rate, and app usage rate. In addition, new users will be required to answer a series of questions to gauge the user’s study preferences and develop an optimized weekly study schedule based on their test dates. The system will also be able to push test and study reminders, keeping its users accountable and on track to their learning goals.

The system will be used by educators and students. For educators, the system can enhance lesson plans and teaching styles by creating a test review deck for the class, incorporating the system for more engaging lessons via gamification and enhanced visual learning, automatically creating a lesson plan, along with encouraging group learning and collaboration through flashcard activities via the sharing and gamification feature. Students can similarly use the same features to study for upcoming tests independently or with a group of friends for a more personalized studying environment.

This system is an improvement over traditional flashcards and other systems as it offers advanced flashcard customization for diverse learning styles, accessible options for disabled users, engaging gamification to increase user retention, and low costs for maintenance and customization by mainly considering York University students for low adoption costs. These features address the limitations of other systems and provides a cost-effective, engaging, and accessible flashcard study system.

The system will be considered a success based on four criteria. First, if each type of user prefers this system over other competing study tools; as determined by the results of a user experience survey along with high user adoption and retention rate. Secondly, if each type of user is reporting improved learning and usability outcomes; as determined by the results of a feedback survey. Thirdly, if the application’s annual hosting expenses are reduced by at least 15% with projected growth in revenue through ads instead of subscriptions in order to provide a tool that is significantly cheaper than our competitors. Finally, if the app is able to successfully scale and handle increased usage to accommodate a growing user base without significant issues. Overall, the system will be considered a success if it can meet most of the criteria.

# Flash Card Study System — Big Stories

- ## Easily Search Public Study Sets (Decks) while maintaining Privacy
    - This would allow users to quickly search through their classmates' study sets for better accessibility. Only study sets that are marked as 'public' will be able to be searchable, while private study sets can only be viewed by the creator. This ensures user privacy, while maximizing accessibility and collaboration with other students.

- ## User, Flashcard, and Study Set Analytics
    - The user should be able to identify their weakpoints, easily guage their learning ability and progress through advanced tracking and visual statistics. Through this, the application can highlight/interpret areas of improvement to help the user study more effectively and efficiently based on time taken, attempts, average score, etc.

- ## Review old cards after the designated time
    - This would allow us to review each set of cards at a specific time and have spaced repetition which maximizes our learning capacity.
